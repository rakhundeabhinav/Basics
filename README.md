🔬 Experiment 1: Basic C++ Programs – Hello World, Calculator & Even-Odd
🎯 Aim
To understand the fundamentals of C++ programming by writing and executing the following programs:

A simple Hello World program.

A menu-driven Calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.

A program to check whether a given number is Even or Odd.

This experiment helps develop understanding of basic syntax, input/output, conditional statements, and arithmetic logic—essential for future work in Data Structures.

🛠️ Tools Used
Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C++

IDE: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Online GDB

📌 Learning Outcomes
Understand the structure of a basic C++ program.

Use cin and cout for input and output operations.

Implement control structures (if-else, switch) and arithmetic operations.

Gain confidence in writing and debugging simple C++ code.
