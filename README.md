ðŸ§ª Experiment 1: Hello World and Simple Calculator in C++

ðŸ”¹ Part A: Hello World Program

ðŸ”¸ Aim

To write, compile, and execute a basic "Hello World" program in C++.

ðŸ”¸ Theory

The Hello World program is a classic starting point for learning any programming language. It helps demonstrate:

==> Basic structure of a C++ program

==> Use of preprocessor directives like #include

==> The main() function as the entry point

==> Output using cout

ðŸ”¹ Part B: Simple Calculator Program

ðŸ”¸ Aim

To develop a simple calculator in C++ that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

ðŸ”¸ Theory

The calculator program introduces key C++ concepts such as:

==> Taking user input using cin

==> Implementing arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /

==> Using conditional logic (e.g., switch or if-else)

==> Handling errors like division by zero

âœ… Conclusion

This experiment provided a hands-on introduction to the basics of C++. The Hello World program helped understand structure and output, while the calculator program introduced user input, logic, and arithmetic. Together, they laid the groundwork for learning more advanced concepts.
