Experiment 1: Hello World and Simple Calculator in C++

🔹 Part A: Hello World Program

🔹 Aim:
To write, compile, and execute a simple “Hello World” program in C++.

🔹 Theory:
The "Hello World" program is traditionally used to introduce the basic syntax of a programming language. It demonstrates:

Structure of a C++ program.

Usage of #include, main(), and cout.

Outputting text to the console.

🔹 Part B: Calculator Program

🔹 Aim:
To create a simple calculator in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

🔹 Theory:
A calculator program introduces:

User input using cin.

Conditional statements (switch or if-else).

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).

Error handling (e.g., divide by zero).

🔹 Conclusion:
This experiment introduced the basics of C++ through the Hello World and Calculator programs. It helped me understand syntax, input/output, and simple logic operations, forming a foundation for further C++ learning.
